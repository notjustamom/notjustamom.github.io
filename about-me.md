![Cassandra](/images/cassandra.jpg){:class="alignleft size-thumbnail"} My name is Cassandra, and my husband and I have three amazing daughters. I am a Christian, an American, a wife, and a mother. I like to cook, I like to be creative, I like to organize things and I like to help others in any way I can.

I was born and raised in Southern California, but have not lived there in over 10 years. I lived in Northern Virginia for 7 years, where I met my amazing husband. We lived in Florida for a few years and just recently moved to Colorado, and so far, we love it.

Above all else, I love Jesus and strive to follow Him & honor Him in all that I do & I pray this blog reflects just that.
