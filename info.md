For as long as I can remember I have always wanted to be a stay-at-home-mom. When I was younger I was lucky enough to have a mom who stayed at home with us. I loved that my mom was PTA president, team mom, class mom, girl scout leader & more. I looked forward to being able to do the same for my children when the time came. I am now blessed to be able to say I have that opportunity, but that wasn't always the case.

Since I have been able to stay home with our children, one thing I have noticed is the way other moms answer the question "What do you do?". So many answer by saying "Oh, I am just a mom" or "Oh I just stay home with the kids" almost like it isn't as important as a job they would get paid to do outside the home.

It almost amazes me. I mean, I think as moms, we have one of the most important "jobs" out there! We teach our children right from wrong. We train them up spiritually. We encourage them to do their best & challenge them. We are coaches, cooks, housekeepers, teachers, spiritual leaders, protectors and more. We are anything but "just" moms and that is what is what this blog will include, all things "mom.'

More information coming soon, because I am busy being a momâ€¦ but not "just" a mom...
